The druggable genome corresponds to the set of protein targets that are amenable to small molecule perturbation. While this set of targets has enormous potential in terms of understanding and treating many disease conditions, the bulk of them are understudied or not studied at all. To address this the NIH initiated the "Illuminating the Druggable Genome" program to characterize the dark regions of the druggable genome. As part of this program, a Knowledge Management Center (KMC) was created to aggregate and integrate heterogeneous data sources and data types creating a centralized location for information about all protein targets indentified as part of the druggable genome. In this presentation we describe the design and deployment of Pharos, the user interface for the KMC. Based on modern web design principles the interface provides facile access to all data types collected by the KMC. We provide an overview of the data sources and types made available via Pharos and then describe the architecture of the system and its integration with KMC & external resources. Given the complexity of the data surrounding any target, efficient and intuitive visualization has been a high priority, to enable users to quickly navigate and summarize search results and rapidly identify patterns. We highlight the approaches we have taken to address this requirement. A critical feature of the interface is the ability to perform flexible search and subsequent drill down of search results. We describe the design of a faceted search interface coupled to the Drug-Target Ontology (DTO) that supports these activites. Underlying the interface is a RESTful API that provides programmatic access to all KMC data, allowing for easy consumption in user applications. We conclude by highlighting some workflows on targets of interest to the IDG program.
